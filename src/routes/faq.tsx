const EXTENDED_FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How long does it take to process a Schengen Visa from Pakistan?",
    a: "Standard Schengen visa processing from Pakistan typically takes 15 to 30 calendar days after your appointment. However, during peak travel seasons (summer and winter holidays), it can take up to 45 days. We recommend applying at least 2 months before your intended travel date. RS Travel and Tours provides early appointment booking assistance to expedite the process."
  },
  {
    q: "What bank statement balance is required for a UK or Schengen visa?",
    a: "While there is no fixed 'official' amount, embassies look for a consistent closing balance that comfortably covers your entire trip (flights, hotels, daily expenses of €100-€150/day) while leaving enough funds for your return. Typically, a steady closing balance of PKR 1.5M to 2.5M over 6 months is recommended. We provide free profile assessments to guide you on exact financial requirements."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer Umrah visas without full packages?",
    a: "Yes, we process standalone Umrah visas for clients who wish to book their own flights and accommodations. However, booking a complete Umrah package through us often results in better overall rates due to our direct B2B contracts with Saudi hotels and airlines."
  },
  {
    q: "Are you an IATA-certified travel agency in Islamabad?",
    a: "Yes, RS Travel and Tours is a fully accredited IATA travel agency. This means we issue air tickets directly from our Blue Area office on over 300+ global airlines, guaranteeing the cheapest live fares without middleman markups."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get a refund if my visa is rejected?",
    a: "Embassy visa fees and VFS/Gerry's service charges are strictly non-refundable as per government policies, regardless of the outcome. However, our consultancy fees are structured transparently, and we ensure your file is 100% accurate before submission to maximize your approval chances."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide cheap flights from Islamabad to London or USA?",
    a: "Absolutely. As direct ticketing agents, we offer exclusive discounted airfares from Islamabad (ISB) to major destinations like London (LHR), New York (JFK), and Toronto (YYZ) via Emirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and British Airways. We also offer special student baggage allowances."
  },
  {
    q: "What documents do I need for a Dubai (UAE) visit visa?",
    a: "For a standard 30-day or 60-day Dubai tourist visa, you only need a clear scanned copy of your passport (valid for 6 months), a passport-sized photograph with a white background, and your CNIC. Processing usually takes 24 to 48 working hours."
  },
  {
    q: "Where is RS Travel and Tours located?",
    a: "Our head office is conveniently located at Office No 6, Mezzanine Floor, Ratta Mansion Plaza, Fazal e Haq Road, Blue Area, Islamabad, 44000. We welcome walk-in consultations Monday through Saturday from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM."
